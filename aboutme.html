        <h1>About D1ME</h1>
        <p>D1ME is a DJ and visual artist from New Orleans, LA.</p>
        <p>Her work is a reflection of her personal liberation through the arts and explores matters of innocence, identity, and the interplay of sound and emotion.</p>
        <p>While her music selection is an avant garde oration of her roots as a Black artist from The South, D1ME’s thoughtful curation celebrates Black and POC artistry in electronic music globally.</p>
        <p>As a leading force in New Orleans’ music scene, D1ME is unmatched for her selection in the city. D1ME co-founded the Techno trio N*S*F*W with DJs Lady Lavender and Gabriela, with the goal of reshaping how art is curated and enjoyed on the dancefloor.</p>
        <p>D1ME’s solo performances range from House to Techno, Ghetto Tech, Footwork, Broken Beat and Club music. A gem in her community, D1ME is dedicated to sharing her unique artistic vision with the world.</p>
